\begin{abstract} % abstract

\parttitle{Background} %if any
Computational biologists daily face the need to explore massive amounts of
genomic data.  New visualization techniques help researchers navigate and
understand these big data. Horizon Charts are a relatively new visualization
method that, under the right circumstances, maximizes data density without
losing graphical perception. 


\parttitle{Results} %if any
Horizon Charts have been successfully applied to understand multi-metric time
series data. We have adapted an existing Javascript library (Cubism) that
implements Horizon Charts for the time series domain so that it works
effectively with genomic datasets. We call this new library DNAism. 


\parttitle{Conclusions} %if any
Users can use DNAism to leverate the power of Horizon Charts to explore their 
own datasets. They can create their own applications or they can expand existing 
ones.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{
  \csentence{Horizon Charts} emerge from applying a set of changes to traditional line
  charts~\textbf{(A)}. We start by coloring the underlying area of the line chart,
  using different hues for positive and negative values. Next, we divide the
  graph in bands and apply a gradient of color that increases along with the
  quantitative value of the variable we are investigating~\textbf{(B)}. In the
  next step, negative values are flipped over the baseline~\textbf{(C)},
  effectively reducing the vertical space by two fold. In a final step, bands are
  collapsed making all of them start at the baseline and providing another level
  of space reduction~\textbf{(D)}.  
  \csentence{We used this technique} to rapidly identify problematic samples
  when performing quality control on large scale sequencing.
  You can see the read depth across whole genome sequences from 24 rhesus macaque
  samples (30x coverage) for genomic region Chr17:1.1M-1.2M~\textbf{(E)}.
  There are regions consistently underrepresented across all the
  samples and sample 32510 has low coverage across the whole genomic region.
  Note that the variable we are exploring in this example, read depth, does not
  contain negative values. Therefore, only green hues appear in~\textbf{(E)}.
